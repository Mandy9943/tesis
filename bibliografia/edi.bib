  abstract   = {Electrodeionization is an ionic separation technology that initially emerged {$\sim$}50 years ago. In an early application, it was utilized to remove metallic species from radioactive wastewater; however, a poor understanding of its functional kinetics has slowed its development and applications. Steadily increasing research efforts have focused on the elucidation of detailed operational mechanisms, thereby enabling the extension of its applications to other fields. To date, electrodeionization has been proven to be an excellent environmentally compatible purification, separation and concentration method. Novel materials have been continuously developed toward the improvement and maturation of this technology, which may lead to enormous environmental and economic benefits on a global scale. This comprehensive review examines the inception, precursor techniques and historic evolution of electrodeionization, as well as its underlying principles, advantages and promising applications in wastewater treatment and water purification.},

  abstract   = {La electrodesionizaci\'on (EDI) es una tecnolog\'ia h\'ibrida de purificaci\'on de agua consiguiendo un alto grado de pureza. Consiste en la combinaci\'on del m\'etodo de intercambio de iones con la electrodi\'alisis, para eliminar las impurezas (iones disueltos). Es un proceso similar a la electrodi\'alisis, se aplica corriente el\'ectrica continua a los electrodos, pero en el caso de la EDI hay membranas semipermeables al paso de iones entre las cuales existe una resina de intercambio i\'onico. Recibe mucha atenci\'on debido a que no necesita qu\'imicos para la regeneraci\'on de resinas.  La aplicaci\'on m\'as com\'un de la electrodesionizaci\'on es el tratamiento de agua para obtener un alto grado de pureza, con una conductividad inferior a 0.1 {$\mu$}S/cm[1]\hspace{0pt} y una resistencia el\'ectrica en un rango de 8-17 M{$\Omega$}M gracias a su elevada eficiencia. gracias a su elevada eficiencia. La electrodesionizaci\'on suele encontrarse tras un proceso de \'Osmosis Inversa (RO) como tratamiento de pulido y, a diferencia de otros m\'etodos, no requiere de tratamientos qu\'imicos, lo que permite que la unidad opere en r\'egimen continuo. Por esta raz\'on, el proceso de electrodesionizaci\'on tambi\'en es conocido como Electrodesionizaci\'on Continua (CEDI).},

  abstract = {Because air is complex and heterogeneous, continuously evolving in time and space and being influenced by atmospheric and geographical conditions, sampling is crucial in air analysis. Moreover, due to the low levels of pollutants present in the atmosphere, enrichment is often required. This review deals with the most common techniques for sampling and preconcentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air samples (e.g., whole-air collection in containers, which is usually combined with preconcentration step, and solid-sorbent enrichment methods). We also describe solid sorbents used to trap VOCs in air, and subsequent desorption techniques. In recent years, there have been many efforts to improve on-line analysis methods, which offer real-time data and are useful in providing rapid results. We examine the application of sorbent trapping to on-line analysis and other techniques for on-line analysis (e.g., membrane extraction and selected-ion-flow-tube mass spectrometry).},

  abstract = {Several calibration approaches were evaluated for the quantitation of volatile organic compounds in air using miniaturized exhaustive and non-exhaustive sampling techniques, such as in-tube extraction (ITEX) and solid phase microextraction (SPME) Arrow. Eleven compounds, 2-ethyl-hexanol, hexanal, nonanal, toluene, ethyl-benzene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetophenone, p-cymene, {$\alpha$}-pinene, trimethylamine and triethylamine, all them found in the natural air samples, were selected as model analytes. Liquid injection, liquid standard addition to the sorbent bed and gas phase standards provided by an automatic permeation system, were evaluated in the case of ITEX packed with laboratory-made 10\% polyacrylonitrile (PAN) material. Two different approaches, based on sampling of gas phase compounds from the permeation system and from sample vial containing gas phase standards, were evaluated for SPME Arrow with two different coatings, commercial divinylbenzene-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (DVB-PDMS) and laboratory-made mesoporous Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41 (MCM-41). In addition, interface model approach was used for the calculation of the real concentration of the target analytes in the sample from the total amount of analytes injected into the GC\textendash MS in the case of SPME Arrow. Similar results were obtained with the different approaches used for the quantitation by ITEX and SPME Arrow. However, the use of gas phase standards with sample matrix similar to the natural samples, allowed the permeation system to provide the most reliable results for the quantitation of the target analytes. For this approach, linearity (expressed as r2 values) ranged between 0.991 and 0.999. The limit of detection ranged from 0.5~\textmu g/m3 (trimethylamine, MCM-41) to 2.2~\texttimes ~10-4~\textmu g/m3 (methyl isobutyl ketone, MCM-41). In addition, the use of the fully automated permeation system provided good reproducibility values that were between 1.4\% (acetophenone, MCM-41) and 7.8\% (methyl isobutyl ketone, 10\% PAN). The linear ranges were at least 3 order of magnitude for all the studied analytes with the exception of the calibration curve developed for trimethylamine with SPME Arrow (linear ranges between LOQ and 4.9~\textmu g/m3 (DVB-PDMS) and LOQ and 9.8~\textmu g/m3 (MCM-41)).},
