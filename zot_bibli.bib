The effect of the process parameters such as applied voltage and membrane type on the quality of the product water was examined. The results show that the conductivity of the product water increased when a high potential is applied to the system. When a voltage of 25V was applied to the system, the conductivity of feed water decreased from 15{$\mu$}S/cm to 0.6{$\mu$}S/cm. At 40V of applied voltage, conductivity of feed water increased from 15{$\mu$}S/cm to 28{$\mu$}S/cm. The thickness of the membrane was also an important parameter for the quality of product water obtained. When the thin membranes (Neosepta-AMX and Neosepta-CMX) were used, the conductivity of the product water increased from15{$\mu$}S/cm to 24{$\mu$}S/cm.},

We were particularly interested in the influence of the reverse osmosis on the data processing sequence. The water quality was evaluated in terms of conductivity; the performances of RO treatment were evaluated in terms of rejection of different species in the groundwater. Also, fouling potential of groundwater was investigated. Results indicate that the reverse osmosis process is well adapted for this treatment; the retention is more than 99\% for the totality of solutes. The conductivity of water to be treated decreases by 1770 {$\mu$}s/cm to 15 {$\mu$}s/cm. To be in agreement with the standards of pharmaceutical industry, a deionizer placed at the exit of the osmosor allows decreasing the conductivity down to 0.5 {$\mu$}s/cm.},

This review aims at recent advances in electrochemical metal recovery techniques, such as electrodeposition, electrosorption, electrodialysis, electrodeionization, and bioelectrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. Additionally, the mechanisms and behaviors of different strategies are reviewed and compared, to overcome the limitations of concentration polarization from dilute metal ions, production of dendrites and spongy deposits, sluggish kinetics of ions transportation, and side-reactions from the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Furthermore, the current challenges and future prospects of electrochemical metal recovery applications are also provided, to establish a process\textendash mechanism\textendash products (PMP) rational design of metal recovery, rather than simple metal removal.}

In this communication, we discuss four electrochemical systems (i.e., electrocoagulation, capacitive deionization, electrodialysis, and electrodeionization), powered with photovoltaic systems, for water treatment.

  abstract = {Trace organic compounds from effluent streams are not completely removed by conventional purification techniques and hence, contaminating groundwater sources. Herein, we report the removal efficiency and rejection mechanisms of three common pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs); caffeine (CFN), omeprazole (OMZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), using commercial nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with different surface characteristics. The RO membranes showed near-complete removal of all PhACs with rejection rates {$>$}99\%. On the other hand, retention capabilities for the NF membranes varied and were influenced by the characteristics of the PhACs, membranes, and the feed solution. In general, during long-term testing, the rejection did not show much variation and followed a trend compatible with the size exclusion (steric hindrance) mechanism. When a real matrix was used, the rejection of CFN by the more tight NF membranes, HL TFC and NFW decreased by {$\sim$}10\%, whereas the removal of SMX by the loose NF membrane, XN45, increased by the same ratio. In short-term testing, the rejection of negatively charged SMX increased significantly ({$\sim$}20\textendash 40\%) at a higher pH of {$\sim$}8 and in the presence of salts. Fouling by the PhACs was more severe on the high-flux NF membranes, HL TFC and XN45, as witnessed by the significant change in Contact angle (CA) values ({$\sim$}25\textendash 50\textdegree ) as well as the flux decline ({$\sim$}15\%) during long-term testing. To summarize, the removal of PhACs by membranes is a complex phenomenon and depends upon a combination of several factors.},

  abstract = {Any unwanted harmful material is known as contaminant. Contaminant can be natural or manmade origin. Pollutants which were not previously or not regularly present in environment are known as emerging contaminations. They are categorized according to their properties, utility or sources. Emerging contaminations include personal health care products, industrial chemicals, heavy metals, biocides, surfactants, gasoline additives, flame retardants etc., which are harmful at above their tolerance level to living systems. By various activities or discharge of effluent, these emerging pollutants enter to the water body. So, their elimination is compulsive as they are toxic if present inside of human, animal or other living creatures. Various filtration methods are used for their removal like, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. This chapter mainly comprises study of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis for removal of various toxics. As microfiltration and ultrafiltration has limitations for removal of impurities nowadays, reverse osmosis, and nanofiltration techniques are used to overcome these barriers. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are mainly influenced by pressure, temperature, viscosity, transmembrane pressure, osmotic pressure, flux rate, concentration polarization, pore size of the membrane, and fouling. Both of these methods have some advantages and limitations over others. However, due to more advantages, one can use these methods for treatment of landfill leachate or emerging contaminations containing waste water to make it potable.},

  abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry is a highly water-dependent economic sector and requires different degrees of water purity. The study presents an overview of the current water quality requirements, as well as limitations and safety considerations for water re-use in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Several principles for implementing circular economy elements into pharmaceutical wastewater treatment procedures are described: the use of recovered solvents as an easily degradable carbon source for the denitrification process, the use of phosphorus-containing wastewater as a nutrient source for activated sludge microorganisms, the use of inorganic acids and bases for pH control in wastewater treatment processes, and the use of Al3+ containing wastewater as a coagulant. The case study indicates that specific wastewater streams can be reused as secondary materials if the chemical composition of wastewater from pharmaceutical batch processing is well constrained and separate collection is ensured.},
